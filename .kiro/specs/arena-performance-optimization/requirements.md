# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical performance bottlenecks and bugs in the Arena (Multiplayer) mode of the Snake game that are causing poor user experience. The Arena mode currently suffers from frame rate drops (10-20 FPS), input lag, collision detection bugs, and UI formatting issues that make the game nearly unplayable on mobile devices and sluggish on desktop. This spec focuses on targeted fixes to restore smooth 60 FPS gameplay while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: AI Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a player, I want AI opponents to respond intelligently without causing frame rate drops, so that I can enjoy smooth gameplay even with multiple AI snakes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Arena mode runs with 5+ AI snakes THEN the system SHALL maintain 60 FPS performance
2. WHEN AI calculations are performed THEN they SHALL be throttled to every 2-3 game ticks instead of every frame
3. WHEN AI pathfinding occurs THEN the system SHALL use cached occupied positions instead of rebuilding Sets every tick
4. WHEN AI direction changes are calculated THEN the system SHALL limit expensive operations like sorting and safety checks
5. WHEN AI snakes evaluate moves THEN the system SHALL use simplified collision detection for performance
6. WHEN multiple AI snakes are active THEN their calculations SHALL be distributed across multiple frames
7. WHEN AI complexity increases THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive player controls

### Requirement 2: Collision Detection Optimization

**User Story:** As a player, I want collision detection to be accurate and fast, so that the game responds correctly without performance lag.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN collision detection runs THEN the system SHALL use spatial partitioning instead of O(n²) checks
2. WHEN occupied positions are calculated THEN they SHALL be cached and updated incrementally
3. WHEN head-to-head collisions occur THEN both snakes SHALL be handled consistently
4. WHEN self-collision is checked THEN it SHALL be optimized for growing snakes
5. WHEN collision detection completes THEN it SHALL not exceed 2ms per frame
6. WHEN board size is 25x25 THEN collision detection SHALL scale efficiently
7. WHEN boss snakes are present THEN their collision detection SHALL be integrated properly

### Requirement 3: Rendering Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game board to render smoothly without visual stuttering, so that I can track snake movements clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN board cells are rendered THEN the system SHALL minimize React component re-renders
2. WHEN 625 board cells update THEN only changed cells SHALL trigger DOM updates
3. WHEN power-ups and particles are active THEN rendering SHALL not drop below 60 FPS
4. WHEN multiple visual effects are active THEN the system SHALL prioritize essential rendering
5. WHEN object pooling is used THEN it SHALL reduce garbage collection pauses
6. WHEN board state changes THEN React.memo SHALL prevent unnecessary component updates
7. WHEN mobile devices are detected THEN rendering complexity SHALL be automatically reduced

### Requirement 4: Input Responsiveness Fixes

**User Story:** As a player, I want my directional inputs to be registered immediately, so that I can control my snake precisely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN direction keys are pressed THEN they SHALL be processed within 16ms (1 frame)
2. WHEN direction queue overflows THEN older inputs SHALL be discarded intelligently
3. WHEN rapid key presses occur THEN the system SHALL prevent "stuck" directions
4. WHEN mobile swipes are detected THEN they SHALL be processed with 25px minimum threshold
5. WHEN touch inputs occur THEN they SHALL not be misinterpreted as taps
6. WHEN input processing completes THEN it SHALL not interfere with game loop timing
7. WHEN multiple inputs are queued THEN only valid direction changes SHALL be processed

### Requirement 5: Firebase Sync Optimization

**User Story:** As a player, I want multiplayer synchronization to be smooth without causing lag spikes, so that the game feels responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Firebase sync occurs THEN it SHALL be batched every 800ms instead of 1000ms
2. WHEN game state updates THEN only changed data SHALL be synchronized
3. WHEN sync operations run THEN they SHALL not block the main game loop
4. WHEN connection issues occur THEN the game SHALL continue in offline mode
5. WHEN sync completes THEN it SHALL not cause frame rate drops
6. WHEN multiple players are active THEN sync frequency SHALL adapt to activity level
7. WHEN Firebase operations fail THEN error handling SHALL not impact gameplay

### Requirement 6: Mobile UI Formatting Fixes

**User Story:** As a mobile player, I want the game interface to display properly without blocking gameplay, so that I can see the board clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN leaderboard is displayed on mobile THEN it SHALL be positioned at the bottom without blocking the board
2. WHEN screen width is ≤768px THEN leaderboard SHALL use compact horizontal layout
3. WHEN power-up indicators are shown THEN they SHALL wrap properly on small screens
4. WHEN active effects are displayed THEN they SHALL not overflow or overlap other UI elements
5. WHEN mobile controls are present THEN they SHALL be touch-friendly with adequate spacing
6. WHEN game messages appear THEN they SHALL be sized appropriately for mobile screens
7. WHEN UI elements are rendered THEN they SHALL maintain proper z-index layering

### Requirement 7: Desktop UI Formatting Fixes

**User Story:** As a desktop player, I want the game interface to utilize screen space efficiently without element overlap, so that I can see all game information clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN screen width is >768px THEN leaderboard SHALL be positioned at the top-right
2. WHEN power-up indicators are displayed THEN they SHALL have proper overflow handling
3. WHEN active effects are shown THEN they SHALL have adequate spacing and margins
4. WHEN multiple UI elements are present THEN they SHALL not overlap or obstruct each other
5. WHEN game HUD is displayed THEN it SHALL scale properly with window resizing
6. WHEN visual effects are active THEN they SHALL not interfere with UI readability
7. WHEN all features are enabled THEN the interface SHALL remain organized and accessible

### Requirement 8: Memory Management and Stability

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to run stably for extended periods without memory leaks or crashes, so that I can enjoy long gaming sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN game runs for extended periods THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable
2. WHEN components unmount THEN all event listeners and refs SHALL be cleaned up properly
3. WHEN game loops are active THEN animation frames SHALL be properly cancelled on cleanup
4. WHEN object pools are used THEN they SHALL prevent memory leaks
5. WHEN Firebase listeners are created THEN they SHALL be properly disposed on component unmount
6. WHEN error conditions occur THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully without crashes
7. WHEN game state resets THEN all resources SHALL be properly released

### Requirement 9: Boss Snake Integration Fixes

**User Story:** As a player, I want boss snakes to move and interact properly with the game world, so that boss waves provide the intended challenge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN boss snakes spawn THEN they SHALL be integrated into the movement loop
2. WHEN boss snakes move THEN their collision detection SHALL work correctly
3. WHEN boss snakes are rendered THEN they SHALL appear on the board properly
4. WHEN boss abilities are used THEN they SHALL execute without breaking game state
5. WHEN boss snakes die THEN they SHALL be removed from all game systems
6. WHEN boss waves end THEN cleanup SHALL occur properly
7. WHEN boss snakes interact with power-ups THEN the interactions SHALL be handled correctly

### Requirement 10: Game State Consistency

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to maintain consistent state without race conditions or synchronization issues, so that gameplay is fair and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN simultaneous moves are processed THEN all collision outcomes SHALL be deterministic

6. WHEN multiple systems update THEN race conditions SHALL be prevented
7. WHEN state synchronization occurs THEN data integrity SHALL be maintained
