# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines enhancements to the existing React/TypeScript Snake game to improve user experience, add strategic gameplay elements, and optimize performance. The game currently features Classic single-player mode and Arena multiplayer mode with AI opponents. The enhancements focus on streamlining Arena mode entry, adding power-up systems, implementing progressive wave-based gameplay, and optimizing performance while maintaining the existing clean architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Streamlined Arena Mode Entry

**User Story:** As a player, I want to quickly start an Arena game without entering my name, so that I can jump into gameplay immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Create Arena" THEN the system SHALL immediately start the game without requiring name input
2. WHEN an Arena game starts THEN the system SHALL auto-generate a player name using patterns like "Player", "Snake_[randomID]", or fun names like "GreenViper"
3. WHEN Arena mode is accessed THEN the game SHALL start within 1 second of clicking the button
4. WHEN Arena mode starts THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing room code system for future multiplayer features
5. IF a user wants to customize their name THEN the system SHALL provide an optional settings menu to change the auto-generated name

### Requirement 2: Power-Up System Implementation

**User Story:** As a player, I want special power-ups to appear during gameplay, so that I can gain temporary advantages and add strategic depth to the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is running THEN the system SHALL spawn power-ups every 20-30 seconds at random locations
2. WHEN a snake collects a power-up THEN the system SHALL apply the corresponding effect immediately
3. WHEN Speed Boost (Yellow) is collected THEN the snake SHALL move at 2x speed for 5 seconds
4. WHEN Shield (Blue) is collected THEN the snake SHALL be immune to one collision
5. WHEN Ghost Mode (Purple) is collected THEN the snake SHALL pass through other snakes for 3 seconds
6. WHEN Freeze (Cyan) is collected THEN all AI opponents SHALL be frozen for 2 seconds
7. WHEN Score Multiplier (Gold) is collected THEN points SHALL be doubled for 10 seconds
8. WHEN multiple power-ups are collected THEN effects SHALL stack intelligently without allowing multiple shields
9. WHEN a power-up is active THEN the system SHALL display distinct visual effects
10. WHEN power-ups are implemented THEN they SHALL work in both Classic and Arena modes

### Requirement 3: Progressive Arena Wave System

**User Story:** As a player, I want Arena mode to feature progressive waves of increasing difficulty, so that I have a challenging survival experience with clear progression.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Arena mode starts THEN the system SHALL begin with Wave 1 containing 3 AI opponents
2. WHEN 1 minute passes THEN the system SHALL start Wave 2 and add 1 more AI with higher intelligence
3. WHEN 2 minutes pass THEN the system SHALL start Wave 3 and increase all AI speeds by 15%
4. WHEN every 3 minutes pass THEN the system SHALL spawn a Boss Wave with a special "Boss Snake" with unique behavior
5. WHEN a wave completes THEN the system SHALL display "Wave Complete!" message
6. WHEN waves progress THEN the system SHALL display the current wave number
7. WHEN a player survives waves THEN the system SHALL award bonus points
8. WHEN Boss Snake is active THEN it SHALL have distinct visual appearance and advanced AI behavior

### Requirement 4: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to run smoothly at 60 FPS even with multiple snakes and power-ups, so that I have a responsive gaming experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game runs with 6 snakes and power-ups THEN the system SHALL maintain 60 FPS performance
2. WHEN game cells are rendered THEN the system SHALL implement object pooling to reduce garbage collection
3. WHEN board cells update THEN the system SHALL use React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
4. WHEN collision detection occurs THEN the system SHALL use spatial partitioning for larger boards
5. WHEN Firebase syncing occurs THEN the system SHALL batch updates every 500ms instead of real-time
6. WHEN power-up collisions are detected THEN the system SHALL use efficient collision detection algorithms
7. WHEN capable devices are detected THEN the system SHALL offer WebGL renderer option for smoother graphics
8. WHEN performance optimizations are implemented THEN Firebase read/write costs SHALL not increase

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Visual Effects and Polish

**User Story:** As a player, I want smooth animations and visual feedback, so that the game feels polished and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN food is consumed THEN the system SHALL display particle effects
2. WHEN collisions occur THEN the system SHALL display particle effects
3. WHEN snakes move THEN the system SHALL implement smooth movement interpolation
4. WHEN snakes die THEN the system SHALL play death animations instead of instant disappearance
5. WHEN food is eaten quickly THEN the system SHALL implement a combo system
6. WHEN points are scored THEN the system SHALL display damage numbers/score popups
7. IF sound effects are enabled THEN the system SHALL play subtle sound effects with toggle option
8. WHEN visual effects are active THEN mobile responsiveness SHALL not be compromised

### Requirement 6: Code Architecture and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the enhanced features to follow existing code patterns and maintain clean architecture, so that the codebase remains maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN power-ups are implemented THEN they SHALL be managed in a separate PowerUpManager class
2. WHEN wave system is implemented THEN it SHALL extend the existing gameRoom state
3. WHEN power-up theming is applied THEN it SHALL use the existing color system
4. WHEN boss snakes are implemented THEN they SHALL leverage the current AI personality system
5. WHEN new features are added THEN they SHALL maintain TypeScript strict mode compliance
6. WHEN features are deployed THEN they SHALL include proper error boundaries for stability
7. WHEN features are implemented THEN they SHALL include feature flags for easy A/B testing
8. WHEN all existing game modes are maintained THEN they SHALL remain fully functional
