# ðŸš€ Snake Game Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Steps

### âœ… **1. Environment Configuration**
- [ ] Verify Firebase configuration in `.env` or Firebase config
- [ ] Check that all API keys are properly set
- [ ] Ensure Firebase project is active and billing is set up (if needed)

### âœ… **2. Build Verification**
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to ensure clean build
- [ ] Test the build locally: `npx serve -s build`
- [ ] Verify all features work in production build

### âœ… **3. Performance Check**
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit on local build
- [ ] Ensure bundle size is optimized
- [ ] Check that all images/assets are optimized

### âœ… **4. Feature Validation**
- [ ] Test power-up system works
- [ ] Test wave progression
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Test error boundaries
- [ ] Test feature flags

## Deployment Commands

### **Firebase Hosting (Recommended)**
```bash
# 1. Build the app
npm run build

# 2. Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy

# 3. Optional: Deploy specific services
firebase deploy --only hosting
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### **Alternative: Vercel**
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

### **Alternative: Netlify**
```bash
npm i -g netlify-cli
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod --dir=build
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### âœ… **1. Functionality Tests**
- [ ] Game loads correctly
- [ ] Arena mode works (auto-name generation)
- [ ] Power-ups spawn and work
- [ ] Wave system progresses
- [ ] Mobile controls work
- [ ] Sound effects work (if enabled)

### âœ… **2. Performance Tests**
- [ ] Page load speed < 3 seconds
- [ ] Game runs at 60 FPS
- [ ] Mobile performance is acceptable
- [ ] Firebase costs are within limits

### âœ… **3. Cross-Browser Testing**
- [ ] Chrome/Chromium
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari (if possible)
- [ ] Mobile browsers

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### **Firebase Console Monitoring**
- Monitor Firestore usage
- Check hosting bandwidth
- Review function invocations (if using)

### **Performance Monitoring**
- Set up Firebase Performance Monitoring
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Track user engagement metrics

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
```bash
# Rollback to previous version
firebase hosting:clone SOURCE_SITE_ID:SOURCE_VERSION_ID TARGET_SITE_ID
```

## Domain Setup (Optional)

### **Custom Domain**
1. Go to Firebase Console > Hosting
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Follow DNS configuration steps
4. Wait for SSL certificate provisioning

## ðŸŽ® **Game-Specific Notes**

### **Feature Flags**
- All features are enabled by default
- Use browser console: `window.featureFlags.override('feature_name', false)` to disable features
- Feature flags persist in localStorage

### **Performance Settings**
- Mobile optimization is automatic
- WebGL rendering is disabled by default (can be enabled via feature flags)
- Object pooling and spatial partitioning are active

### **Error Handling**
- Error boundaries will gracefully handle feature failures
- Game continues even if individual features fail
- Errors are logged to console and localStorage

**Ready to deploy! ðŸš€**
